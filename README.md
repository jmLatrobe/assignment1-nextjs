# Assignment 1 â€“ Next.js Application

This project was developed as part of Assignment 1 using **Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)**.

## Git Workflow

For version control, I used Git and GitHub.  
- The main branch (`main`) was kept clean and production-ready.  
- I created feature branches such as `feature/navbar`, `feature/tabs`, and `feature/darkmode`.  
- Each branch contained descriptive commits, and I used Pull Requests to merge changes back into `main`.  
- This workflow ensured clear history and traceability of changes.

## Features
- Navigation bar, header, and footer
- About page
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Hamburger menu with CSS transform
- Tabs page (up to 15 tabs) with localStorage persistence
- Output button (inline HTML export, works for 1/3/5 tab demos)

## Use of AI Tools (Declaration)

I used ChatGPT as a support tool during development.  
- ChatGPT assisted me with explanations of Git workflow, debugging React/Next.js errors, and structuring the assignment documentation.  
- All code was written, tested, and verified by me, with AI acting only as a guide/reference.
