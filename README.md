This project was developed as part of Assignment 1 using **Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)**.

## Git Workflow

For version control, I used Git and GitHub.  
- The main branch (`main`) was kept clean and production-ready.  
- I created feature branches such as `feature/navbar`, `feature/tabs`, and `feature/darkmode`.  
- Each branch contained descriptive commits, and I used Pull Requests to merge changes back into `main`.  
- This workflow ensured clear history and traceability of changes.

## Use of AI Tools (Declaration)

I used ChatGPT as a support tool during development.  
- ChatGPT assisted me with explanations of Git workflow, debugging React/Next.js errors, and structuring the assignment documentation.  
- All code was written, tested, and verified by me, with AI acting only as a guide/reference.
